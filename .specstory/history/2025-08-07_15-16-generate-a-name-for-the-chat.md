I see you're having an issue installing the "everything-as-an-interface" project with Poetry. Let me look at your pyproject.toml file to help resolve this error.

I need to help you fix the Poetry installation issue with your project. 

The problem is that Poetry can't find your package properly. Your pyproject.toml is set up for setuptools, but you're trying to use Poetry for package management.

To fix this, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

```toml:pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "everything-as-an-interface"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "将各种网站和应用转换为可编程接口，实现自动化和数据聚合"
authors = ["Everything As An Interface Team <info@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{include = "src"}]
```

Alternatively, you could:

1. Use `poetry install --no-root` if you only want to install dependencies
2. Add `package-mode = false` under a new `[tool.poetry]` section if you don't want Poetry to handle packaging

Your project structure looks correct with the src directory containing your package code, but Poetry needs its own configuration to properly recognize it.

使用最简单的requirement.txt来保存依赖吧，我打算使用pip安装

I'll create a simple requirements.txt file for your project based on the dependencies in pyproject.toml.

---

Could not find file 'requirements.txt' in the workspace.

---

Here's a requirements.txt file with all your main dependencies:

```
playwright>=1.30.0
httpx>=0.22.0
cryptography>=38.0.0
pydantic>=1.10.0
fastapi>=0.90.0
uvicorn>=0.20.0
pymongo>=4.3.0
redis>=4.4.0
aioredis>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=0.21.0
```

And for development dependencies, you can create a requirements-dev.txt:

```
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.20.0
black>=22.12.0
isort>=5.10.0
mypy>=0.990
ruff>=0.0.240
sphinx>=5.3.0
sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.1.0
```

Then install with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And for development:
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Remember to use a virtual environment as recommended.
