我已完整通读代码与测试。下面给你一份简洁高信噪的总体理解与关键关系速览。

### 项目定位
- 将多网站/应用通过浏览器自动化标准化为“插件接口”，实现数据抓取与自动化编排。

### 架构总览
- 核心聚合入口：`EverythingAsInterface` 负责初始化并串联各核心组件（插件、调度、订阅、通知、账号）。
```20:79:src/__init__.py
# ... existing code ...
self.plugin_manager = PluginManager()
self.scheduler = Scheduler()
self.captcha_center = CaptchaCenter()
self.subscription_system = SubscriptionSystem()
self.notification_center = NotificationCenter()
self.account_manager = AccountManager(
    master_key=self.config.get("master_key"),
    storage_path=self.config.get("accounts_path", "./accounts")
)

# 组件相互连接
self.scheduler.set_plugin_manager(self.plugin_manager)
self.scheduler.set_notification_center(self.notification_center)
self.scheduler.set_account_manager(self.account_manager)
# ... existing code ...
```

- 核心模块
  - 插件管理器 `core/plugin_manager.py`：自动发现并加载 `src/plugins/*.py`（基于类属性 `PLUGIN_ID`）。
  - 任务调度器 `core/scheduler.py`：按间隔执行插件的 `fetch()`，支持回调、错误计数、通知。
  - 会话管理 `core/account_manager.py`：会话加密存储、平台定义、Cookie过滤/更新/有效性检查。
  - 订阅系统 `core/subscription.py`：主题-订阅者的 pub/sub，支持过滤和增量推送。
  - 通知中心 `core/notification.py`：控制台/邮件/Webhook/自定义渠道。
  - 验证码中心 `core/captcha_center.py`：图形/滑动/人工干预的统一处理入口（默认走人工占位逻辑）。
  - 浏览器工具 `utils/browser.py`：Playwright 封装（启动、页面操作、Cookie操作、截图等）。

### 核心数据流（以收藏夹监听为例）
1) 首次创建会话 → 状态为 `not_logged_in`（未含 Cookie）  
2) 调度器执行插件 → 插件尝试用会话 Cookie 登录，失败则引导人工登录  
3) 人工登录成功 → 插件获取 Cookie → 更新会话（持久化、加密）  
4) 插件抓取数据 → 对比上次结果得出新增项 → 通过订阅系统回调/通知

- 任务执行关键路径
```175:304:src/core/scheduler.py
# ... existing code ...
plugin = self.plugin_manager.instantiate_plugin(task.plugin_id)
plugin.configure(task.config)

# 若插件需要会话且有 session_id，则注入会话数据（注意：这里只注入了会话本体，而非 account_manager）
if plugin.needs_account() and self.account_manager and task.config.get("session_id"):
    session = self.account_manager.get_session(task.config["session_id"])
    if session:
        plugin.set_accounts([session])
        plugin.select_account(session["id"])
        # 会话有效性检查（失效会标记 needs_login）
        valid, message = self.account_manager.check_session_validity(session["id"])
        if not valid:
            self.account_manager.mark_session_needs_login(session["id"])
# ... existing code ...
data = await plugin.fetch()
# ... existing code ...
if task.callback and data:
    await task.callback(data)
# ... existing code ...
```

### 插件机制与示例
- 插件抽象：`plugins/base.py` 定义生命周期（configure/start/fetch/stop）、账号/配置、验证码占位接口。
- 小红书插件：`plugins/xiaohongshu.py`
  - 尝试 Cookie 登录 → 若失败走人工登录页面，等待登录后提取 Cookie。
  - 抓取收藏夹页面 → 解析 DOM（容错多个选择器）→ 计算新增项。
  - 注意：插件内部尝试调用 `self.account_manager.update_session_cookies(...)` 保存 Cookie，但系统未显式注入 `account_manager`，因此它使用了 `hasattr(self, 'account_manager')` 进行判断。

```260:343:src/plugins/xiaohongshu.py
# ... existing code ...
# 登录成功后，获取并保存 Cookie
cookies = await self.browser.get_cookies()
if cookies:
    # 仅在插件实例带有 account_manager 时才更新会话
    if hasattr(self, 'account_manager') and self.selected_account:
        session_id = self.selected_account.get("id")
        if session_id:
            self.account_manager.update_session_cookies(session_id, cookies)
# ... existing code ...
```

- 当前系统没有把 `account_manager` 注入到插件实例（只注入了会话数据）。这会导致首次人工登录后 Cookie 无法被持久化保存（依赖插件自己能拿到 `account_manager`）。这是一个值得修正的点（见下文“潜在改进”）。

### CLI 与示例
- 示例程序 `example.py`：展示系统初始化、创建会话/主题/订阅、添加调度任务与回调、启动调度器的完整流程。
- 命令行 `python -m src`：
  - `list` 列出插件
  - `session list/create/remove` 管理会话
  - `run <plugin_id> --session <id> --config <file> --output <file>` 运行单插件
- API 服务器命令存在占位（提示未来支持 FastAPI）。

### 测试
- `tests/core/test_account_manager.py`、`tests/core/test_plugin_manager.py` 完整覆盖了平台/会话/插件发现/实例化等核心逻辑。
- `tests/utils/test_browser.py` 明确跳过（Playwright mock 复杂度高），目前不会跑浏览器相关单测。

### 依赖与环境
- 建议用虚拟环境隔离（你规则已要求）。  
- 已列出：pytest、pytest-asyncio、black、isort、mypy、ruff、sphinx、Pillow、playwright
- 代码实际用到但未在 `requirements-dev.txt` 声明：
  - 缺少 `cryptography`（`account_manager.py` 用了 `Fernet` 和 `PBKDF2HMAC`）
  - 缺少 `httpx`（`notification.py` 的 `WebhookChannel`）
  - 可选项：`fastapi`、`uvicorn`（命令行 server 子命令提示后续支持）
- README 提及 `pyproject.toml`，但仓库中不存在此文件（文档与仓库略有不一致）。

### 潜在改进/风险点（高价值）
- 插件依赖注入不完整：
  - 建议在任务执行时把 `account_manager` 注入到插件实例（或通过统一 `PluginContext` 注入所需依赖），确保人工登录后 Cookie 能持久化。
- 依赖缺失：
  - 将 `cryptography`、`httpx` 加入 `requirements-dev.txt` 或迁移到 `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`。
- 服务器占位：
  - CLI 的 `server` 子命令尚未实现，后续若要开放 API，需要定义契约（插件管理、任务、订阅、通知的 HTTP 接口）。
- 文档一致性：
  - README 的项目结构中写了 `pyproject.toml`，实际缺失；建议更新文档或补齐文件。
- 浏览器测试：
  - 当前 `BrowserAutomation` 单测被跳过；若追求高可靠，考虑基于 Playwright 的官方 fixtures 或抽象接口做细粒度 mock。

### 状态更新
- 我已阅读主要文档、核心代码、插件与工具层、以及测试用例，梳理架构与数据流，并标注了关键改进点（插件未注入 `account_manager`、依赖缺失等）。

- 如果你需要，我可以：
  - 为 `Scheduler` 和 CLI 运行路径补充对插件的 `account_manager` 注入编辑；
  - 补齐依赖并给出最小变更的安装与运行指令；
  - 补上简单的集成测试用例，验证人工登录后 Cookie 持久化的路径。

- **完成内容概览**
  - 全面通读并输出了高层架构、模块职责、执行流程、依赖与改进点。
  - 指出了两处重要不一致/缺失：依赖未声明、插件未注入会话管理器。

很棒，接下来请你为我补充缺失项

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating code improvements**

I want to edit requirements-dev.txt to include cryptography and httpx, as well as fastapi and uvicorn, which could be marked as optional for development.

I’m also considering adding an injection of the account_manager for plugin creation in the PluginManager, but it shouldn’t know about it directly. A better place could be Scheduler._execute_task or the CLI run_plugin.

I noticed that BrowserAutomation.get_cookies and set_cookies require type hints for List[Dict[str, Any]], but the necessary imports aren’t found at the top of src/utils/browser.py.
**Identifying code adjustments**

I don’t see any major issues, and the logging configuration looks fine. 

However, in the XiaohongshuPlugin, they refer to `datetime` for generating a timestamp, which indeed is imported correctly at the top. There’s also a mention of tenant virtualization usage, but we won’t set up conda.

When it comes to tests, httpx is imported but not used, which seems fine since we're adding dependencies.

We need to ensure no linter errors are introduced while I update requirements-dev.txt to include 'cryptography>=41.0.0', 'httpx>=0.27.0', and maybe 'fastapi>=0.110.0' and 'uvicorn>=0.29.0'. Regarding the account_manager injection into the plugin instance, I’m considering whether it should be added to BasePlugin for clarity.
**Updating BasePlugin structure**

I’m considering updating BasePlugin to include an optional property for `account_manager: Optional[AccountManager] = None`. However, BasePlugin currently doesn’t import AccountManager, which could lead to a circular import issue. Instead, I could type it as `Any` or set the attribute later. 

To keep the code style consistent without major restructuring, I’ll define `self.account_manager = None` in the BasePlugin's `__init__`, typed as `Optional[Any]`, ensuring that `Any` is also imported. 

Additionally, in the CLI for `run_plugin` in src/__main__.py, I’ll set `plugin.account_manager = system.account_manager` after instantiation.
**Addressing plugin and documentation issues**

If `plugin.needs_account()` and `args.session` are already set, injecting the `account_manager` would assist the plugin in saving cookies. 

I also see another opportunity for injection: during Scheduler creation, I can set `plugin.account_manager = self.account_manager`. I’ll add code to pass the `account_manager` to the plugin drop as well.

Regarding the README mismatch with `pyproject.toml`, I wonder if we should create a minimal one, but it seems the project currently uses `requirements-dev.txt`. Since there’s no proper packaging config, ‘pip install -e .’ would likely fail. Should we fix the documentation or add that missing configuration? The user's request to "补充缺失项" feels a bit ambiguous.
**Updating instructions and code**

I think it might be safer to change the README to instruct users to run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` instead of `pip install -e .`. There’s an inconsistency since the Quick Start already includes the former. I’ll aim to update the README to match the Quick Start, but I need to ensure that I’m following the guidelines to avoid heavy formatting.

Also, “补充缺失项” suggests we implement additional dependencies and the account manager injection. So, I plan to also add `cryptography` and `httpx` to `requirements-dev.txt`. I’ll update both the README installation line and the project structure section to reflect the current reality. I’ll proceed with these edits using the apply_patch tool to maintain consistency throughout.</details></think>

我将补充缺失依赖，并在任务执行与 CLI 运行路径中为插件注入 `account_manager`，同时在插件基类中显式声明该属性；另外更新安装说明以匹配现有依赖文件。现在开始进行这些编辑。

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Applying code modifications**

I’m calling read_lints on the modified files, which include src/plugins/base.py, src/core/scheduler.py, src/__main__.py, and making a note that requirements-dev.txt doesn’t have linting. Next, I'll implement the necessary edits. After that, I’ll proceed to apply patches to both scheduler.py and __main__.py, as well as to requirements-dev.txt. It feels like a step-by-step process, but I'm making sure everything is covered!</details></think>

---

我将：
- 在调度器与 CLI 执行路径中为插件实例注入 `account_manager`，确保登录后 Cookie 能持久化。
- 在开发依赖中补充缺失的 `cryptography` 与 `httpx`。

现在进行这些编辑并检查静态错误。

- 我已为插件实例显式增加可注入的 `account_manager` 属性，并在调度器与 CLI 运行路径实际完成注入，确保首次人工登录后 Cookie 能持久化保存。
- 我已补充缺失依赖到 `requirements-dev.txt`：`cryptography` 与 `httpx`。

变更要点
- 编辑 `src/plugins/base.py`：在 `BasePlugin.__init__` 中添加 `self.account_manager: Optional[Any] = None`，用于依赖注入。
- 编辑 `src/core/scheduler.py`：执行任务时实例化插件后注入 `account_manager`，再 `configure`，保证插件在 `fetch`/登录流程可写会话。
- 编辑 `src/__main__.py`：单插件运行命令中同样注入 `account_manager`。
- 编辑 `requirements-dev.txt`：新增 `cryptography>=41.0.0`、`httpx>=0.24.0`。

安装与运行（建议在虚拟环境中）
- 安装依赖与浏览器内核:
  - Windows PowerShell:
    - 创建并激活虚拟环境（例如 venv 或 conda）
    - pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    - playwright install
- 运行示例: `python example.py`
- 运行 CLI:
  - 列出插件: `python -m src list`
  - 创建会话: `python -m src session create --platform xiaohongshu`
  - 运行插件: `python -m src run xiaohongshu --session <session_id>`

- 我已检查修改文件，无新的静态检查错误。

_**User**_

当前的账号管理有问题，我实际上想要的是cookie管理，一种cookie代表着一个网站的登录，浏览器初始化时可以选择合并多个cookie（也就是说浏览器启动后会有多个网站是已登录状态），你需要记录下来，浏览器cookie你需要以一种方式保存到本地，每次可以选择使用哪一个或多个cookie，cookie中登录了哪些账号我需要有能力知道，并且不同网站的cookie可能过期，过期之后你应该删除掉cookie并提醒用户重新登录，请你完善这个功能

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Developing BrowserAutomation Features**

I’m thinking about how to initialize BrowserAutomation with a merged list of cookies. The selection needs to happen when configuring a task or plugin. It'll include a "cookie_ids" parameter for better compatibility, while keeping the session_id.

The user wants persistence for cookies, so I’ll consider encrypted storage similar to sessions.enc, likely in the accounts directory, renamed to cookies.enc. We’ll also need to track logged-in accounts using metadata like "account_label" and "site."

I’ve got to ensure that expired cookies are accurately marked for removal and notify users through NotificationCenter. Plus, I’ll update the Xiaohongshu plugin to allow multiple cookies.
**Enhancing the XHS Plugin**

I'm working on the XHS plugin, which only needs its own site cookies. However, BrowserAutomation has to load multiple cookies at startup for different sites. To tackle this, I’ll implement a `load_cookies` method in BrowserAutomation to add all cookies.

The plan involves a better architecture where the CookieManager is used by the Scheduler to compile cookies for selected sites before plugin actions. The plugin will create its own BrowserAutomation instance and call `start()`, followed by `login()`, which currently sets cookies from `selected_account`.
**Updating Plugin Configuration**

I’m considering changing the plugin base to accept both a cookie_manager and a 'selected_cookie_ids' or 'cookie_selection' configuration per plugin. This way, the plugin can retrieve relevant cookies based on its site's domains and use browser.set_cookies accordingly. However, since the user wants merging across websites, we can implement a more generic ability.

I plan to create a CookieManager class with an `add_cookie(cookie_bundle)` method to handle cookie bundles per site. It will include essential metadata like cookie_id, site, user_alias, and computed expiry, allowing us to manage cookies effectively.
**Planning Cookie Management Methods**

I'm laying out several methods for cookie management. I want to include `add_site_cookie(site_id:str, cookies: List[dict], user_alias: Optional[str])`, which will return a cookie_id. I'll also need methods like `get_cookie(cookie_id)`, `list_cookies(filter by site_id)`, and `get_cookies_by_site(site_id)`.

Additionally, I’ll implement cookie validation, removal, and merging. It’s important to persist these cookies to cookies.enc using encryption and initialize by loading from storage.

For integration, I'll incorporate this into EverythingAsInterface for cookie management and may add cookie-related CLI commands, ensuring the user can select which cookies to utilize. I'll provide updates in the README as necessary.
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
**Implementing CookieManager Features**

I’m planning to enhance the CookieManager by enabling it to load platforms.json directly from storage. I’ll implement methods like `get_cookie`, `list_cookies`, and `remove_cookie(s)` among others, and ensure that `merge_cookies(cookie_ids)` returns a merged list.

I want to validate cookies by checking expiration timestamps and define them as valid if at least one remains unexpired after pruning. I’ll also add functions to mark cookies used and summarize login info. 

When executing tasks, if cookie_ids are present, the manager will prune and fetch cookies while notifying users of any expired ones. The plugin will handle logins, while I’ll integrate these changes into EverythingAsInterface and update the CLI accordingly.</details></think>

---

我将实现一个新的 `CookieManager`（加密本地保存、选择与合并多站点 Cookie、过期清理和通知支持），并将其集成到系统入口、调度器、CLI 与小红书插件中。随后运行静态检查修复潜在问题。

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Integrating CookieManager**

I need to integrate CookieManager into the system and update EverythingAsInterface. The user wants cookie-centric management, where one cookie corresponds to a website login. When initializing the browser, it should be able to merge multiple cookies for different sites. I'll have to record browser cookies locally and know which accounts are logged in. Additionally, I need to set up logic to notify the user when cookies expire and ensure integration into Scheduler and plugins. It seems there’s a lot here to tackle!
**Adding Cookie Support in BasePlugin**

I see that BasePlugin currently has a mechanism for selected accounts, and I can add support for cookie injection. My thought is to create methods like `set_cookies(cookies: List[Dict])`, or maybe use an `injected_cookies` attribute in the config. I need to keep consistency with current plugins, especially for account management and cookie injection.

The user wants cookie management, so I might integrate both methods while ensuring the XHS plugin uses cookies from CookieManager. For the Scheduler, if `cookie_ids` are present, I should set the plugin attributes accordingly. However, I must consider the current logic for account cookies.
**Modifying BasePlugin for Cookie Management**

I need to consider that BasePlugin's accounts are generalized, and `set_accounts` expects a list of dictionaries. I can create a pseudo account with a unique id like 'bundle-merge' that uses a merged cookies list, which might work with the current code path. If `cookie_ids` are provided, I could set the accounts list to include this merged cookies account and select it.

Since the plugin doesn’t use an account manager for updates, I should add a `cookie_manager` attribute. This would allow the plugin to save updated cookies after login. I'll also modify the plugin to check for `cookie_manager` during manual login to manage and save new site cookies appropriately.
**Planning Cookie Management Features**

The user wants the browser to merge multiple cookies and save them locally so that they can choose from one or more cookies each time. I need a way to detect which accounts are logged in, and our CookieManager has an `account_label` field for this purpose. Identifying the username may require plugin-specific detection from the DOM or APIs, which could be tricky to implement.

I might provide a placeholder to accept optional `account_label` when saving site cookies, along with a CLI for cookie management commands like list, add, remove, merge, and export. I'll add a new CLI subcommand called `cookie` to help manage these actions. However, fetching cookies from the plugin browser after login could add complexity that I need to consider.
**Implementing Cookie Management Features**

I need to add CLI commands for managing cookies, like listing and removing cookie IDs, and also enable the `run` command to accept a list of cookie IDs for merging. The Scheduler will need to support cookie tasks, and I should update the README accordingly.

The user wants the functionality to manage cookies, so I’ll integrate the CookieManager into EverythingAsInterface and modify the Xiaohongshu plugin to utilize it after a manual login. I'll also ensure that expired cookies get deleted automatically and notifications are sent to the user. This implementation could add a lot of complexity, but it seems essential!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying README.md**

I’m thinking about how we tried to patch README.md, but some of our contexts might not match perfectly. It’s important that I carefully read the existing file to understand its content before making any modifications. I’ll proceed to open the file and review it thoroughly. This way, I can ensure our changes are appropriate and accurate, so we avoid any confusion in the documentation! Let's get to it!</details></think>

---

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating methods and documentation**

I need to add a method to update account info and clear expired cookies. I’ll create a `check_expired_and_cleanup()` function to delete expired bundles and notify users. It's essential to integrate scheduled cleanup during the startup loop and send notifications through the NotificationCenter. 

I also have to update the README regarding the Cookie Manager. We encountered a hiccup with patching it, so I'll approach this carefully. Lastly, I should update the `__main__.py` to include cookie listing and removal commands.
**Enhancing cookie management**

I’m focusing on improving the cookie management system. We've added the ability to choose cookie IDs using `--cookies`. Also, I included a notification for users to re-login when cookies expire, which is part of the `validate_and_prune` scheduler method for invalid IDs. 

Additionally, I think a periodic cleanup routine would be helpful, so I'll implement a method in CookieManager to prune expired cookies. This cleanup will run every 10 minutes, and I need to ensure it sends notifications about removed cookies as well. I'll add the `prune_all_expired()` method accordingly.
**Improving cookie handling in plugins**

I’m working on enhancing cookie management within the browser plugin. The BrowserAutomation tool doesn’t accept cookies before starting, which means I have to set them with `context.add_cookies` after initiating the browser.  

We've implemented cookie merging and injection, allowing users to select multiple cookies using the CLI `--cookies` option. I need to keep track of which accounts are logged in, so I'll store an `account_label` and an `account_info` dictionary. Updating the Xiaohongshu plugin to detect the logged-in username could also be beneficial, though it might require specific site selectors.
**Implementing cookie management in CLI**

I’m planning to create CLI subcommands for managing cookies, specifically to list and remove them. First, I’ll edit `__main__.py` to add a subparser called "cookie" with actions for listing, removing, and cleaning up expired cookies. 

I’ll also implement methods in `CookieManager` for setting account info and retrieving cookies based on site IDs, but I might not need those right away. After adjusting the imports and updating the README to include cookie CLI usage, I’ll run linters and finish implementing the cleanup features.</details></think>
