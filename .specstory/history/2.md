<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up testing environment**

To kick off our tests, I need to set up a virtual environment and run pytest. This can get heavy, so I’m thinking of adjusting the code to handle deprecation while keeping `AccountManager` as a wrapper around `CookieManager` for now. By focusing on `CookieManager`, we can represent sessions using cookie bundles and unify storage for platform definitions. We have to ensure that `platforms.json` exists, and consider stopping construction of `AccountManager` in `EverythingAsInterface` while keeping some compatibility.
**Defining Session Management**

I'm considering creating a new `SessionManager` that integrates more closely with cookies, as the user prefers a cookie-centric approach and may want to remove the old structure. The current code uses sessions in `example.py` and `__main__.py`, with plugins relying on cookies from the selected account. To align with the user's request, I'd suggest deprecating `AccountManager` but retaining the class for backward compatibility. For session operations, instead of writing to `sessions.enc`, we could initiate an empty bundle in `CookieManager` while exploring other approaches to unify usage across plugins.
**Refining Session Selection**

I need to think about how the CLI currently uses the `--session` parameter for selecting sessions. I can modify it to accept cookie IDs instead, though it's only partially implemented with the existing `--cookies` parameter. The plugin needs to account for session management and returning accounts. To strike a compromise, I could mark `AccountManager` as deprecated while maintaining its functionality. I’ll also work on implementing an 'Account' class within `CookieManager` for managing accounts through cookies, although the existing code doesn’t utilize this yet. Maybe adding migration options could help, too.
**Implementing Session Management Changes**

Given the limited time, I think I should create a thin facade within `AccountManager` that doesn’t store cookies directly but instead references `CookieManager`. I’ll design functions to mirror session management while using `CookieManager` cookie IDs. This means updating both the plugin and CLI to utilize the cookie storage and merging from `CookieManager`, while keeping session commands that now create 'logical sessions' based on cookie bundle IDs. I'll also need to modify how `AccountManager` is implemented, shifting from heavy encryption to using a `sessions.json` file that maps to cookie IDs and allows for easier management.
**Refactoring Session Management**

I'm planning to modify `src/__init__.py` so that `CookieManager` is created before `AccountManager`, passing it as a parameter. I’ll update `AccountManager` to stop using encryption and rely on plain JSON in `sessions.json`, while maintaining necessary behaviors to ensure tests still pass. 

The idea is to keep the `AccountManager` class but mark it as deprecated, transitioning it into a wrapper that holds minimal metadata, while centralized cookie storage happens in `CookieManager`. I'll ensure the plugin functionality remains intact, doing this incrementally to manage the refactor smoothly.
**Adjusting Session Handling**

To maintain compatibility with the example, I’ll modify `get_session` to return cookies based on `CookieManager` cookie IDs. This means I’ll keep the `cookie_ids` mapping in the session and compute cookies upon retrieval. When updating session cookies, those will be added to `CookieManager`, and I'll update the `last_cookies` field for compatibility. I also need to reorder the initialization in `src/__init__.py` to create `CookieManager` before passing it to `AccountManager`. 

Additionally, I'll maintain relevant imports and ensure the tests for sessions and cookie handling pass, filtering cookies as necessary. I plan to review `requirements-dev.txt` afterward for dependencies.</details></think>

我刚完成了项目中与账号、Cookie、会话相关代码的快速巡检。接下来我会把 CookieManager 作为唯一的 Cookie 存储来源，将 AccountManager 改造成一个仅做“会话元信息 + CookieManager 引用”的兼容层：在保存会话 Cookie 时写入 CookieManager 并记录 cookie_ids，在读取会话时动态从 CookieManager 合并返回 cookies。这样保持插件和 CLI 基本兼容，同时把真实 Cookie 管理集中到 CookieManager。现在我会并行修改 `src/__init__.py` 的初始化顺序并为 `AccountManager` 注入 `cookie_manager`，以及重构 `src/core/account_manager.py` 的核心方法以引用 CookieManager。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating tests for refactor**

I need to update the tests according to the new design since the user wants a refactor rather than just keeping them passing. I’ll change the AccountManager to accommodate this and update the CLI and plugin accordingly. For example, the XiaohongshuPlugin currently uses `account_manager.update_session_cookies(...)`. I’ll allow it to fetch and merge from CookieManager when 'cookie_ids' are present. I'll ensure backward compatibility while also updating the initialization to accept the cookie_manager parameter.
**Modifying cookie management**

I need to update `AccountManager.update_session_cookies` to save to CookieManager and store cookie_id references in the session instead of raw cookies. I'll modify `create_session` to use 'cookie_ids' instead of 'cookies': None. To maintain backward compatibility, I could store both types but prefer 'cookie_ids'. I should also update `src/core/__init__.py` to reference the changes. The `xiaohongshu.py` plugin also needs revisions to ensure it fetches cookies using `cookie_manager` before login. I’ll implement this logic for simplicity!
**Updating cookie saving processes**

I need to revise the part where we save cookies. Instead of using `account_manager.update_session_cookies` during manual login, I’ll call `cookie_manager.add_site_cookie` and update `account_manager` to attach `cookie_id` to the session, setting the status to logged in. The existing code has a fallback for compatibility, but we can optimize it with the new updates. Additionally, I’ll update the `__init__` method to include the `cookie_manager` parameter and adjust the CLI code to maintain session loading and account management. Adding cookie info to the session list could be optional.
**Implementing account_manager changes**

I need to update `account_manager` to accept a `cookie_manager` parameter and store it in `self.cookie_manager`. In the `create_session`, I’ll set "cookies" to None for legacy reasons and initialize "cookie_ids" as an empty list. For the `update_session_cookies` method, I’ll filter relevant cookies and save them to `cookie_manager` using `add_site_cookie`. I might remove `session["cookies"]` to reduce duplication and prefer `cookie_ids`, but I’ll ensure backward compatibility for testing.

Lastly, I’ll adjust `check_session_validity` to validate against `cookie_ids` instead of `session["cookies"]`, using the cookie manager for lookups.
**Implementing cookie management updates**

I need to create a helper function to fetch cookies by merging cookie bundles. Then, I’ll update methods like `get_session`, `get_sessions_by_platform`, and `_get_safe_session_info` to show cookie status derived from `cookie_ids` or stored cookies. For `get_session_cookies`, I’ll prioritize fetched cookies from `cookie_manager` if `cookie_ids` exist, otherwise falling back to stored cookies.

I see that we need to maintain backward compatibility in tests by retaining the old cookie storage behavior while adding the new `cookie_ids` tracking. By implementing updates and adjustments in the `xiaohongshu.py` plugin as well, this should help align everything together smoothly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refactoring account management**

I need to refactor account management with CookieManager as the main focus. The user suggested I keep everything necessary and remove what's unnecessary. I've already modified the initialization order for EverythingAsInterface to create the CookieManager first and pass it into AccountManager. I've ensured that AccountManager references CookieManager while updating cookies and maintained session compatibility. The validity checks have been updated to primarily use CookieManager too. I realized I imported Any, so I’m good there. The tests still work since they rely on the session cookies.
**Updating account management**

I changed `src/__init__.py` to pass the cookie_manager parameter and made sure that the AccountManager signature accepts it—good! Now I need to check plugins that use `account_manager.update_session_cookies` and expect `session["cookies"]`. For example, the Xiaohongshu plugin saves to the cookie_manager and calls the update method, which still works fine. It logs, "Cookie已保存到会话" and uses the selected_account in the login process. I’m thinking we should ensure the plugin prefers merged_cookies first. Also, it might be useful to update the CLI to show cookie info, but that’s not strictly necessary.
**Updating tests for cookie functionality**

I might need to update the tests to ensure they still pass. The tests check `_get_safe_session_info` with a `cookie_count` of 2, but our code relies on `cookie_ids` if they’re present. Since the tests use `update_session_cookies`, it adds the `cookie_id` and updates `session["cookies"]` to filtered results. 

However, the tests don’t initialize a `cookie_manager` in the AccountManager fixtures—they just create an AccountManager with a `master_key`. This means that when `update_session_cookies` runs, `self.cookie_manager` might be None, but that condition is handled gracefully to avoid errors. I need to verify what else can be removed in the code, as the user requested the removal of unnecessary parts, but we can't delete AccountManager without rewriting the tests and CLI.
**Evaluating cookie management**

The request is to keep what's necessary, so we'll maintain the AccountManager but change its cookie storage to refer to CookieManager. We might also consider removing the duplication of `platforms.json` between CookieManager and AccountManager since they're loaded from the same storage, but for now, it's acceptable. However, if we want CookieManager to be the primary source of truth, we’ll need to unify platform definitions eventually. 

I'll also think about updating the documentation to highlight CookieManager as the primary source, though this isn't urgent. As for `sessions.enc`, it's still in use for tasks and plugins, so we should keep it for now.
**Updating code and communication**

We need to update type hints and imports related to the `cookie_manager` parameter in AccountManager. Although we didn't export it in `src/core/__init__.py` earlier, that’s been taken care of. We can't run tests right now, but I can read through them to confirm they should pass. 

Regarding the Xiaohongshu plugin, it successfully saves to CookieManager and calls `update_session_cookies` post-login, so no further changes are needed there. I should summarize everything concisely in a final message, including bullet points about changes and next steps, like running tests.

CookieManager is now the authoritative source, and sessions store `cookie_ids` referencing cookie bundles, while older logic is still supported. There are possibilities for further cleanup and migration, like detecting session entries with cookies that lack `cookie_ids` and creating a bundle. However, that’s not required. 

I’ll ensure the final message is clear, concise, and emphasizes no linter errors, along with a mention of the edited files without showing any code. Let's finalize this!</details></think>

- 我已通读并定位了账号相关实现与使用点：`AccountManager`、`CookieManager`、`XiaohongshuPlugin`、CLI（`src/__main__.py`）、`Scheduler`、以及对应测试。
- 我已完成一次最小破坏的重构：以 `CookieManager` 为唯一的 Cookie 存储与校验中心，`AccountManager` 仅保留“会话元信息 + 引用 CookieManager”的兼容层。

本次编辑
- 调整系统初始化顺序，使 `CookieManager` 成为权威，`AccountManager` 注入并依赖 `CookieManager` 保存与读取 Cookie。
  - 编辑 `src/__init__.py`：先初始化 `cookie_manager`，再初始化 `account_manager` 并传入 `cookie_manager`。
- 精简并改造 `AccountManager` 行为，仅保留必要的“会话元信息”管理，Cookie 全部委托给 `CookieManager`：
  - 编辑 `src/core/account_manager.py`：
    - 新增构造参数 `cookie_manager`；会话结构中新增 `cookie_ids` 字段用于引用 `CookieManager` 中的 Cookie 集合。
    - `update_session_cookies`：过滤平台相关 Cookie 后，优先保存到 `CookieManager` 并记录 `cookie_ids`；为兼容旧逻辑，仍在会话中保留一份 `cookies`。
    - `check_session_validity`：优先通过 `cookie_ids` 调用 `CookieManager.validate_and_prune` 判断会话是否仍有有效 Cookie；失败再回退检查会话内 `cookies`。
    - `get_session_cookies`：优先通过 `cookie_ids` 从 `CookieManager.merge_cookies` 合并返回；失败回退会话内 `cookies`。
    - `_get_safe_session_info`：优先基于 `cookie_ids` 估算 `cookie_count`，无 `cookie_ids` 时回退到会话内 `cookies`。
- 未修改插件与 CLI 交互协议，确保现有行为兼容：
  - `XiaohongshuPlugin` 继续支持通过 `merged_cookies`、会话 `cookies` 方式注入；手动登录后既保存到 `CookieManager` 也仍调用 `AccountManager.update_session_cookies`（兼容老逻辑）。
  - CLI `run` 命令的 `--cookies` 依旧能通过 `CookieManager` 合并注入浏览器。
  - 调度器 `Scheduler` 也已具备对 `cookie_ids` 的支持（此前已有），无需改动。

影响与兼容性
- 现在 Cookie 的唯一权威存储为 `CookieManager`（`accounts/cookies.enc`），会话仅保存 `cookie_ids` 引用与基础元信息；为不破坏测试与旧代码路径，会话仍冗余保留最近一次的 `cookies`。
- 测试用例无需改动：`tests/core/test_account_manager.py` 中使用的接口与断言保持兼容。
- 已运行静态检查，无新增 Lint 问题。

后续可选优化（不阻塞当前使用）
- 平台定义存在于 `AccountManager` 与 `CookieManager` 两处的重复加载，后续可统一为单一来源。
- 在 `AccountManager._load_sessions` 时做一次数据迁移：若旧会话存在 `cookies` 且无 `cookie_ids`，自动生成 `cookies` 集合并写入 `CookieManager`。

- 变更文件
  - `src/__init__.py`
  - `src/core/account_manager.py`

如果你希望我继续做平台定义的统一，或加上旧会话自动迁移到 `CookieManager` 的逻辑，我可以直接补上。

_**User**_

目前的内容符合下面的功能吗？请完善
我实际上想要的是cookie管理，一种cookie代表着一个网站的登录，浏览器初始化时可以选择合并多个cookie（也就是说浏览器启动后会有多个网站是已登录状态），你需要记录下来，浏览器cookie你需要以一种方式保存到本地，每次可以选择使用哪一个或多个cookie，cookie中登录了哪些账号我需要有能力知道，并且不同网站的cookie可能过期，过期之后你应该删除掉cookie并提醒用户重新登录

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying feature requirements**

I need to ensure that our current code meets all the requirements and fills in any missing features. 

First, I need to handle cookie management, where each cookie bundle represents a website login. The CookieManager supports adding site cookies, which include necessary information.

Next, I must look into how browser initialization can merge multiple logged-in cookies. 

Lastly, I should track which cookie combinations are used during browser initialization to maintain accurate usage records.
**Enhancing cookie management**

The CookieManager currently sets the last used date for each bundle, but it doesn’t track merged sessions as combinations. I could create a ‘CookieSession’ record or usage logs that store these combinations, perhaps in a new 'usage_history' list with timestamps and IDs.

I also need to ensure that browser cookies are saved to disk securely, and users should be able to select which cookies to use easily through the CLI. Lastly, I want to improve the detection of logged-in accounts, ensuring we have reliable methods for various sites.
**Improving account detection**

I need to ensure we can identify which accounts are logged in with the cookies. Currently, we provide account information per bundle, which is good, but it may need more robust detection.

I could add a 'probe_account_info' function that visits sites via cookies to fetch profile data, but that's quite a bit of extra code. For now, I can implement a 'refresh_account_info' method that uses a headless browser to navigate and fetch content.

Additionally, it's important to detect and delete expired cookies while notifying users to re-login, and the CookieManager already handles expired cookies effectively.
**Enhancing cookie management features**

Everything seems to be looking good so far! The cleanup task handles invalid cookie bundles effectively and notifies users when necessary. 

We also have the feature where multiple cookies can be merged during browser initialization, but I need to ensure that the plugin correctly uses these merged cookies right away. It’s nice that the XiaohongshuPlugin sets them and checks for logins.

I must record which cookie bundles are used for each browser initialization. I’m considering adding a method in CookieManager to log this usage, perhaps in a new file or by modifying the existing cookies.enc format. A simpler solution could be extending CookieManager to maintain a 'cookies_usage.jsonl' for clarity.
**Implementing cookies usage tracking**

I need to create a new encrypted file named 'cookies_usage.enc' to track cookie usage. I’m considering where to call the record usage function—possibly in __main__.py after merging cookies and in the Scheduler when merging cookie IDs. 

We have CLI options to manage cookies, but I might want to add commands for detecting account info using BrowserAutomation, though that might feel too complex. 

Additionally, I need to ensure our tests remain valid after modifying the AccountManager class. I will implement a method in CookieManager to record merges with timestamp, cookie IDs, and context, while also ensuring notifications prompt users to re-login. I'll go ahead and patch the necessary files and include docstring comments for clarity.</details></think>

---

我将为 CookieManager 增加“合并使用记录”功能，并在 CLI 与调度器中调用它；同时在清理通知中增加“请重新登录”的提示。随后我会运行静态检查以保证无新问题。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Ensuring cookie management functionality**

I need to make sure our functionality meets the user’s cookie management requirements. Each cookie bundle will represent website logins, and the browser should be able to merge multiple cookies for logged-in sites. It's important that cookies are saved locally and users can choose which to keep. I also need to monitor logged-in accounts, handle expired cookies, and notify when re-login is needed. Our current CookieManager supports various tasks like merging, marking usage, and cleaning up expired cookies.
**Clarifying cookie management features**

I’m considering how the CLI and Scheduler call the mark_used function. In the CLI, the command merges valid IDs and sets plugin attributes while tracking usage by bundle rather than by merged set. The user wants to log merged set usage, so I might need to introduce a "usage history" feature in the CookieManager.

I also need to know which accounts are logged in via cookies. The CookieManager supports account detection, but I realize there isn't a straightforward API for querying logged-in accounts. Lastly, for expired cookies, the prune_all_expired function removes expired bundles, but I must ensure users are reminded to re-login effectively.
**Enhancing notifications and usage tracking**

I’m thinking about how to improve our notifications. We already send warnings with a list, but we could update the message to remind users to re-login and maybe add a "needs_login" suggestion. Notably, we can utilize the NotificationCenter to send these updates, including the prompt "请重新登录." 

Additionally, it seems beneficial to implement new methods. For example, I could create a record_merged_usage method to log usage sessions, including cookie IDs, timestamps, and more, and provide an API for listing recent merges. I’m considering storing this in cookies.enc under a new key or in a separate file named cookie_usage.json.
**Modifying usage history and storage**

If I want to add a top-level key for usage history, I need to update the load/save code because the CookieManager currently maps cookie IDs directly. Instead, it might make sense to create a second encrypted file named 'cookie_usage.enc' for this purpose. 

I'll implement methods for loading, saving, and recording usage history, like _load_usage_history and _save_usage_history. Each usage record will include details like IDs, timestamps, and source information. I also plan to improve reminder messages in cleanup tasks and create a method to return which accounts are logged in across merged cookies.
**Adding account retrieval and usage tracking**

I need to provide a way for users to retrieve accounts after they choose merges, so adding an API called get_accounts_for_cookie_ids will return a list of account details. To do this, I'll implement new additions without affecting existing tests. 

In the CookieManager, I’ll introduce a usage history file and several new methods, such as _load_usage_history and record_merge_usage. Each merge will store relevant information like timestamps and account labels. I'll also update cleanup messages and introduce a prune method to remind users to re-login. Let's get started on these edits!</details></think>

### 是否符合需求
- 合并多站点 Cookie 注入浏览器: 已实现。可在运行插件或调度任务时选择多个 CookieID，系统会合并并注入到同一浏览器上下文，多个站点将同时处于已登录状态。
- 本地安全保存 Cookie: 已实现。加密存储于 `accounts/cookies.enc`；合并使用记录加密存于 `accounts/cookie_usage.enc`。
- 可选择使用任意一个或多个 Cookie: 已实现。CLI 和调度器都支持传入多个 CookieID。
- 能识别 Cookie 中登录了哪些账号: 已实现。支持从 Cookie/页面内容提取账号信息，支持汇总查询。
- 过期清理与提醒: 已实现。周期清理任务会修剪/删除过期 Cookie 集合，并通过通知中心提示“请重新登录”。

### 我做了哪些完善
- `CookieManager` 增强
  - 新增使用记录：`record_merge_usage`、`list_usage_history`，保存于 `cookie_usage.enc`（加密）。
  - 新增账号汇总：`get_accounts_for_cookie_ids`（按 CookieID 列表汇总站点与账号）。
  - 清理通知文案包含“请重新登录并保存新的 Cookie”提示。
- CLI
  - `python -m src cookie history [--site <site_id>]` 查看最近的合并使用记录。
  - `python -m src cookie accounts --ids <id1,id2>` 查看这些 Cookie 对应的站点和账号汇总。
  - 运行插件时记录合并使用，并标记使用时间。
- 调度器
  - 执行任务前合并注入 `config.cookie_ids`，并记录一次使用。

### 如何使用（示例）
- 列出 Cookie 集合:
  - `python -m src cookie list [--site xiaohongshu]`
- 查看 Cookie 详情:
  - `python -m src cookie info --id <cookie_id>`
- 运行插件并合并注入多个 Cookie:
  - `python -m src run xiaohongshu --cookies <cookie_id_1>,<cookie_id_2>`
- 查看账号汇总:
  - `python -m src cookie accounts --ids <cookie_id_1>,<cookie_id_2>`
- 查看合并使用记录:
  - `python -m src cookie history [--site xiaohongshu]`
- 清理过期 Cookie 并提醒重新登录:
  - `python -m src cookie prune`

- 登录获取 Cookie 的方式
  - 首次运行相关插件时按页面登录，插件会调用 `CookieManager.add_site_cookie()` 持久化并尝试提取账号信息（如用户名），之后可直接复用该 CookieID。

- 存储与兼容
  - Cookie 权威存储在 `CookieManager`；会话中仅留 `cookie_ids` 引用（兼容保留最近一次的 `cookies` 字段，旧测试/代码不受影响）。

- 关键变更文件
  - `src/core/cookie_manager.py`：新增使用记录/账号汇总/通知完善
  - `src/__main__.py`：新增 `cookie history`、`cookie accounts` 子命令，并在 run 中记录使用
  - `src/core/scheduler.py`：记录任务级 Cookie 合并使用
  - `src/core/account_manager.py`：以 `cookie_ids` 引用 `CookieManager`，其余仅保留会话元信息

- 如需，我可以继续：
  - 自动迁移旧会话内的 `cookies` 到 `CookieManager` 并生成 `cookie_ids`。
  - 把平台定义抽到单一来源，移除重复加载。
